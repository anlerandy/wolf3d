# Map editing rules
No empty line should be in between two rules.
  - Height amd Texture should always have the same number of characters and lines.
  - Height : 9 = Wall

List of texture :
  - `B` = brick
  - `M` = Metal
  - `S` = Stone
  - `W` = Wood
  - `R` = the 4 colors (default)
  - `-` = Breakable wall

OBJ line rules :
  - J = PLAYER_START (must be set) ex. : `J|1|1|0` = `PLAYER_START|position x|position y|rotation Ëš`
  - T = DAY_TIME ex. `T|1` = `DAY_TIME|NIGHT` or `T|0` = `DAY_TIME|DAY`
